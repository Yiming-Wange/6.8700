        "\n",
        "In biology, a mutation refers to any change in the DNA sequence that can alter the amino acid sequence of a protein. Proteins, encoded by genes, perform essential functions in living organisms, and any change in their structure due to mutations can impact their function.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Wild-Type Proteins**: This term refers to the most common form of a protein found in a population, serving as the standard version for comparison in genetic studies. In contrast, a **mutant** protein has a different sequence from the wild-type.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Gain of function mutations** introduce new or enhanced activities in a protein.\n",
        "**Loss of function mutations** reduce or eliminate the ability of the protein to perform its normal functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "A goal is to predict how specific mutations in the protein sequence affect its function. This prediction helps in understanding how genetic variations contribute to different traits, diseases, or responses to drugs, much like predicting how changes in a software's code would affect its operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "We use the ESM model to perform mutation effect prediction. We will compare our prediction to an experimental deep mutational scan (DMS), where most single amino acid mutations (and some combinations of mutations) are made to the Adeno-associated virus\n",
        "(AAV) capsid protein and the fitness impact of each mutation is measured. Here, the fitness is the ability of the capsid to assemble and package (viability). Higher scores are more fit or gain of function, and lower scores have less fitness or loss of function.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1.C.1 Question\n",
        "\n",
        "Many scoring functions from protein language models correlate with effects on protein function. One such function is the masked marginal scoring function, which computes the log probability difference between wildtype and mutated residues. Here, M are the masked residues where mutations occur, x^mt_i is the mutant-type residue at position i and x^wt_i is the wild-type residue at position i. We will just consider single mutations at a time.\n",
